# SYCL Compliant KD-Tree Construction and Nearest Neighbour Search Algorithms

This library is a submodule, developed as a part of my research for Master's thesis. It consists of a novel non-recursive implementation of SYCL-compliant nearest neighbor(NN) search algorithm using DPC++, targeting Heterogeneous Computing Systems with accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. It also contains the SYCL-compliant implementation of [Ingo Wald's KD-Tree construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00120).
